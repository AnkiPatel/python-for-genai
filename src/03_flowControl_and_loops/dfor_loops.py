# FOR LOOPS

# Types of loops:
# 1. For loops - iterate over sequences (lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, etc.)
# 2. While loops - execute as long as a condition is True

# ITERATING OVER A LIST OF NUMBERS

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Loop through each number in the list

for n in numbers:
    print(n)

# FILTERING TWEETS CONTAINING AI OR MACHINE LEARNING

# Loop through each tweet and filter those related to AI or Machine Learning
for tweet in tweets:
