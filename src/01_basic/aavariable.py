# PYTHON VARIABLES

# Assigning a numeric value to a variable
celsius_temp = 30
print(celsius_temp)  # Output: 30

# Assigning multiple variables in a single line
temperature, user_age, c = 1, 2, 3

# Another example of multiple assignments with mixed type
age, name = 28, 'Alice'

# Printing variables to confirm assignment
print(temperature, user_age, c)  # Output: 1 2 3
print(age, name)  # Output: 28 Alice
